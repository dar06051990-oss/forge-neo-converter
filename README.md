# Forge Neo Converter

Forge Neo Converter is a Forge Neo extension for converting `.safetensors` diffusion models and text encoders between precision and quantization formats directly from the Forge UI.

It adds a top-level **Converter** tab with two modes:

- **Model mode** scans diffusion model/checkpoint folders and lets you choose an architecture profile.
- **Text encoder mode** scans Forge text encoder folders and automatically uses the protected `Text-Encoder` profile.

Converted files are saved next to the selected source file. The output name follows the same naming behavior as the source converter: an existing precision suffix is stripped when detected, then the selected target format is appended.

Example:

```text
ZIT_Luxury_1_0_bf16.safetensors
ZIT_Luxury_1_0-int8_convrot.safetensors
```

## Source and Attribution

This extension is based on the ComfyUI custom node project:

[Starnodes Model Converter](https://github.com/Starnodes2024/comfyui-starnodes-modelconverter)

The conversion logic, model profiles, quantization formats, layer preservation profiles, file naming behavior, and metadata handling are adapted from the original **Star Ultimate Model Converter** node.

This Forge Neo extension ports that workflow into a native Forge Neo tab and adjusts quantization metadata so converted models load correctly through Forge Neo's mixed precision loader.

## Features

- Top-level **Converter** tab in Forge Neo.
- Separate **Model mode** and **Text encoder mode** tabs.
- Converts `.safetensors` diffusion model and text encoder files in place.
- Saves converted files in the same directory as the selected source.
- Supports architecture-specific model profiles from the original Starnodes converter.
- Automatically protects text encoder embeddings, normalization layers, biases, and output heads in BF16.
- Supports Forge Neo-compatible mixed precision metadata.
- Shows a text log for conversion progress, layer statistics, output path, and errors.
- Scans standard Forge model/text encoder folders and their configured extra directories.

## Supported Target Formats

- `nvfp4`
- `fp8`
- `mxfp8`
- `int8`
- `int8_convrot`
- `int4_convrot` — ConvRot W4A4 quantization with 4-bit weights and group-wise scales (equivalent to the `w4a4_convrot` name used by some converters).
- `w4a8_convrot` — ConvRot W4A8 quantization with grouped 4-bit weights and INT8 execution.
- `fp16`
- `fp32`

Quantized formats require `comfy-kitchen`. `int4_convrot` and `w4a8_convrot` additionally require a current Forge Neo/comfy-kitchen build that provides their respective layouts.

## Qwen-Image 2.1: Community Test Notes

The existing **Qwen-Image** profile in `models.json` was tested with Qwen-Image 2.1-based checkpoints in Forge Neo. **No Qwen-Image 2.1-specific converter code or profile was required** for these tests.

Observed results (community testing; not a universal compatibility or quality guarantee):

- **NVFP4:** successful conversion from a working FP16/BF16 source; the converted checkpoint generated and edited images successfully in Forge Neo and ComfyUI.
- **W4A8 ConvRot (`w4a8_convrot`):** successful conversion and image generation/editing; best observed quality/speed balance in these particular trials.
- **INT4 ConvRot (`int4_convrot`):** conversion completed, but generated images suffered noticeable degradation/blurring in the tested checkpoint.
- Different source checkpoints, seeds, samplers, quantization methods and runtime environments can produce different results. These tests do not establish that every Qwen-Image 2.1 variant or quantization mode is supported.

For an initial Qwen-Image 2.1 conversion test, select **Model type → Qwen-Image** and start from a known-good, higher-precision source checkpoint. Keep the source checkpoint for A/B comparisons.

## Search Paths

In **Model mode**, the dropdown scans `.safetensors` files from:

```text
models/diffusion_models
models/unet
models/Stable-diffusion
```

It also scans directories passed to Forge Neo with:

```text
--ckpt-dir
```

In **Text encoder mode**, the dropdown scans:

```text
models/text_encoder
models/text_encoders
models/clip
```

It also scans directories configured with:

```text
--text-encoder-dirs
```

The singular `models/text_encoder` directory is Forge Neo's native text encoder folder; the other names support shared ComfyUI-compatible layouts.

If files are added while Forge Neo is already running, click the refresh button in the corresponding mode.

Source folders are scanned recursively, including nested symbolic links and
Windows directory junctions. Repeated targets and cyclic directory links are
detected and skipped.

## Installation

Clone or copy this repository into your Forge Neo `extensions` directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/sd-webui-forge-neo/extensions
git clone <this-repository-url> forge-neo-converter
```

Install dependencies in the Forge Neo environment if they are not already installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If your Forge Neo installation uses `uv`, install the dependencies through the same environment used by your `webui-user.bat` or launch setup.

Restart Forge Neo completely after installation.

## Usage

1. Start Forge Neo.
2. Open the **Converter** tab.
3. Open **Model mode** or **Text encoder mode**.
4. Select a `.safetensors` source file. In Model mode, also select the matching model type/profile.
5. Select the target format.
6. Select `cuda` or `cpu`.
7. Click **Convert**.
8. Watch the log until the conversion completes.

The converted file is written to the same folder as the source model.

## Forge Neo Loading Notes

For quantized output, Forge Neo should detect the model as mixed precision. During model loading, a healthy log usually includes a line similar to:

```text
Using MixedPrecision for Model
```

If Forge Neo prints unexpected `weight_scale` keys, for example:

```text
NextDiT Unexpected: [...weight_scale...]
```

then the file was not created with Forge-compatible quantization metadata. Delete that converted file, fully restart Forge Neo so the latest extension code is loaded, and convert again.

During conversion, the log should include a metadata line like:

```text
Quantization metadata: 90 layers, first key: model.diffusion_model.layers.0.feed_forward.w1
```

The exact layer count depends on the model and selected profile.

## Requirements

- Forge Neo
- Python environment used by Forge Neo
- PyTorch
- safetensors
- comfy-kitchen
- NVIDIA GPU recommended for CUDA conversion and hardware-friendly quantized formats

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

## Upstream Profile Data

The model profile data used by this extension is kept in [models.json](models.json). It is adapted from the upstream Starnodes Model Converter profile definitions.

Only the standalone model and text encoder converter workflows are exposed in Forge Neo. The additional ComfyUI-only node UI and optional AIO splitter controls are not exposed in the Forge Neo tab.

## License

This extension is a Forge Neo port based on the Starnodes Model Converter project. Respect the license and terms of the upstream project and the licenses of any models you convert.
